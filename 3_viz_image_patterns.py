We now have the basic objects and app interface under our belt. Time to start doing real world work. 
Let's start examining and prepping our data for analysis. 
We are going to import an unlabeled set of images, calculate embeddings, and then explore what the embeddings 
teach us about our data.

# download 300 images from fickr, just images with no metadata. Might want it as well with the metadata but
# probably not. Load the data using the "directory of images" importer


# Now load an embedding model from the zoo. Explain the page and why we chose it

# Now run the embeddings

# Talk about the "run" and show it with the dataset

# Now visualize the embeddings in the app
